You are an expert plant biologist.
Your task is to categorize free-text tissue descriptions into one of the following categories:

 - 'root'
 - 'leaf'
 - 'other'
 - 'flower'
 - 'seedling'
 - 'seed'
 - 'shoot apex'
 - 'callus'
 - 'sensory system'
 - 'placenta'
 - 'protoplast'
 - 'ovary'
 
 
You must select only one category per tissue.

Be sure to provide a category label for each tissue. 

Write out the results a comma-separated table: tissue,tissue_category
Be sure to quote each value in the table.

Use the 'other' category label when none of the other tissue category labels are appropriate. 

Categorize each of the following tissue descriptions into one of the above categories:

 - '10-day-old seedling'
